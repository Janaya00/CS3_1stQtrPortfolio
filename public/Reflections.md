# **Q1 End of Lessons Reflections**

### - List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.

1. Arithmetic Operators  
This is a topic that I first encountered in Grade 7 with Python and later on in Grade 8 because of C++. Thanks to my prior experience, I was able to grasp it well and apply it to JavaScript. However, I also had to learn how it works specifically in JavaScript, as there are some differences. For example, sometimes JavaScript treats the + operator as a string operator rather than an addition operator. Through practice, I have learned how to handle these cases correctly and continue using arithmetic operators effectively. 
  
  
2. Variable Declaration 
 Apart from arithmetic operators, this is also something I've encountered in the previous school years. In Java Script, the way these are declared are by using var, let or even const. Since I have learned the kinds of variables via C++ and python, and how "const" works in C++, it was easy to understand it in JS, and as a result, I am also very familiar with it. 
  
 
3. While Loop Structure
 The while loop is a very direct structure. It holds a condition, and if it is true-- the code block runs. I encountered this a lot in C++, and it works the same way in Jave Script. Due to this, I am familiar it, even using it a lot in graded exercises and in long tests. 
  
 
4. Conditional Operators 
 To reiterate, this is something that I've also learned in the previous school years. It is used to perform different actions based on whether a condition is true or false. In JavaScript, the main conditional operators include ==, ===, !=, !==, <, >, <=, and >=. Through practice, I have learned how to apply them correctly in JavaScript programs. 
  
 
5. If-Else Statements
If-Else statements are a fundamental structure for decision-making when coding. I first learned them in Python and C++, so I was already familiar with the concept of executing certain code blocks when a condition is true and alternative codes when it is false. In JavaScript, the structure works the same way, using if for the condition and else for the alternative. Because of my prior experience, I understood how to use them effectively in JavaScript and have applied them in graded exercises and programming tasks. 
 
  

### List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed. 

1. Arrays
I have a bit of knowledge on arrays as it was discussed for C++ in grade 8, but I haven't mastered this. I realized this when I was doing the coding portion for LT2 in CS, and I tried to integrate arrays in my code, but I didn't really seem to know how to use it as well as I did in C++, which is why I wish to further learn about it.

2. For loops
I know how for loops work, but there are times where I get confused on what it outputs, and how to maneuver it correctly so that I get my desired output. For example, when writing the triangle bonus-code, I had a hard time visualizing what it would output and what to use in order for it to output correctly.

3. Functions
Though I know how to do functions, I sometimes find it challenging to determine the best way to structure them for more complex tasks. Functions are very useful because they allow me to reuse code and break down problems into smaller, manageable parts. For example, when working on coding exercises in JavaScript, I have learned to pass parameters and return values, which makes my programs more organized and efficient. I aim to further improve my skills in writing functions, especially in combining them with arrays and loops to solve more advanced problems.

4. Style related structures in HTML
These include adding photos, fixing fonts, background images, adding animations and etc. to the website. I know how to do the basics, but I want to learn the more complex parts of it.

5. Debugging 
 Apart from the coding and the functions, what I want to learn about more the most is debugging. This is because it is a constant issue I struggle with, in graded exercises, in practice codes, and long tests.

### - Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

My plan of action will be as follows:
Firstly, since I know what I want to learn or further understand, I will look for resources that can help me. Next, when I have time, I can browse these resources-- particularly focusing on the parts that I don't understand. After this, I can also schedule or attend consultations with our teacher, to further expound on the information I've gathered from those resources and to learn about it on an academic level. Lastly, and what I deem most important, is that I will actually **practice** what I've learned to make progress, and to achieve my goal of understanding it. 

### - In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

For me, the most that I think was effective were the use of demonstrations combined with reading the resources given in KHub. But, I don't find anything that was done in class ineffective, because it all contributed to teaching us how to us JS and HTML.
