## **Key points from SONA 2025 that I found weird**

- The West Philippine Sea Territorial Dispute had not been addressed
- President BBM stated band-aid solutions, such as the P20/kilo bias, to issues concerning agriculture 
- “Sa tulong ng DOST, ginagamit natin ang mga magagandang dulot ng agham, tulad ng mga nadiskubre at nagawa ng ating mga siyentipiko at imbentor.”,“Maglalaan tayo ng sapat na pondo para rito. Alang-alang sa ating mga mag-aaral, hihilingin ko ang buong suporta ng ating Kongreso.” However, our STEM sector remains underdeveloped, resulting in a continued outflow of talent abroad.

## **2 paragraphs of reflection**

The State if the Nation’s Address, or SONA, is not an unfamiliar title. As a kid, I grew up constantly bring told by my parents to watch it. Though, I have only started listening in the last two years, and have only completely watched it in the most recent one. I don’t know if it’s because I have matured more, or because I can actually grasp what is discussed, but upon reflecting; I’ve realized a lot, and have been hit with the cold hard truth.

The Filipinos can’t always hide behind the positive demeanor and the facade of being humorous. We can’t just stay still when  no matter how many jokes we post on FaceBook, the extremities that our country is going through will never get any less serious. That is, if we do not limit ourselves to only talking about the nation’s state, but also take action upon it. With that, phrases such as “we can” and “we will” would be replaced with “we have” and “we’ve done”, and solutions will not be a “bandaid solution” but will provide a long term benefit for our citizens. To achieve this as a scholar, especially as a scholar of our country, am not only tasked with learning about the issues, but also with contributing to the solutions, ensuring that we, as a nation, move from conversation to action for a better future.



## **1 word/ phrase/ or sentence do you have for the Philippines after hearing SONA 2025**

God Bless the Philippines.
